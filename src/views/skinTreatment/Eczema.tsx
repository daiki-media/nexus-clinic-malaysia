  const faqData = [
    { q: "Is there a cure for eczema?", a: "No. Eczema has no known cure. The goal of treatment is to manage symptoms effectively, reduce the frequency and severity of flares, prevent secondary infections and maintain quality of life. Many children improve significantly or go into long remission by their teenage years, but a substantial proportion carry the condition into adulthood. Adults who develop eczema for the first time have a different pattern, often with persistent hand or facial eczema driven by contact exposures and occupational factors. At Nexus Clinic KL, we are honest with patients from the first consultation: treatment controls eczema, it does not eliminate it." },
    { q: "Are topical steroids safe for long-term eczema management?", a: "When used correctly, topical corticosteroids are safe and effective for managing eczema. The risk of side effects is related to the potency grade, the body area, the duration of continuous use, and the age of the patient. Mild potency steroids such as 1% hydrocortisone are safe for use on the face and in children for short courses. Moderate and potent steroids used for limited periods on the body under medical supervision carry very low risk of the side effects that have created widespread fear. The risk of skin thinning does not apply to correctly supervised short-course application. At Nexus Clinic KL, every topical steroid prescription includes a written application guide." },
    { q: "Why does my eczema keep coming back despite treatment?", a: "Recurring eczema despite treatment usually results from one of four causes. First, topical treatment being stopped too early when the skin appears to be improving, leaving subclinical inflammation that rebuilds. Second, an unidentified trigger that is continuing to activate the immune response, most commonly house dust mites or a contact allergen. Third, inadequate emollient use between flares, meaning the skin barrier never fully repairs. Fourth, secondary bacterial colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus that maintains chronic low-level inflammation. At Nexus Clinic KL, we systematically review all four causes in patients presenting with treatment-resistant recurring eczema." },
    { q: "What triggers eczema in Malaysia specifically?", a: "Malaysia's tropical environment creates a unique combination of triggers not present in temperate climates. House dust mites thrive in Malaysia's permanently humid indoor environment, with sensitisation rates of 60 to 80 percent. Sweat and heat loading from the climate continuously challenge the eczematous skin barrier. Daily temperature cycling between outdoor heat and heavily air-conditioned offices disrupts barrier function. Periodic haze episodes increase air pollution. Harsh soap products in the context of twice-daily bathing strip the skin lipid layer repeatedly. Effective eczema management in Malaysia requires addressing these specific environmental factors alongside pharmacological treatment." },
    { q: "Can children with eczema be treated at Nexus Clinic KL?", a: "Yes. Eczema is extremely common in Malaysian children, affecting over 20 percent according to the Dermatological Society of Malaysia. At Nexus Clinic KL, our doctors are experienced in assessing eczema in infants, children and adolescents and prescribing age-appropriate treatments including mild-potency topical corticosteroids, pimecrolimus for face and neck in children over two years of age, fragrance-free emollients formulated for paediatric skin, and antihistamines appropriate for the child's age and weight. Parents are provided with written guidance on applying treatments correctly to their child." },
    { q: "What is the difference between eczema and contact dermatitis?", a: "Atopic dermatitis is a genetic chronic inflammatory condition where the skin barrier is intrinsically compromised and the immune system is prone to overreaction. It tends to run in families alongside asthma and allergic rhinitis. Contact dermatitis is a reaction to a specific external substance, either through an immune-mediated allergic mechanism or through direct chemical irritation. The two conditions can coexist in the same patient. The clinical distinction matters because contact dermatitis requires identification and removal of the specific trigger, while atopic dermatitis requires long-term barrier management and anti-inflammatory treatment." },
    { q: "When should I use wet wrapping for eczema?", a: "Wet wrapping is a technique suitable for moderate to severe eczema on the limbs when itch is severe enough to disrupt sleep and topical treatment alone is not providing adequate relief. It involves applying a thick layer of emollient to the affected limb, covering with a damp cotton bandage and placing a dry bandage on top. The wet layer enhances emollient absorption and provides cooling relief that reduces the itch-scratch cycle. It should only be used with emollient under the wrap, not with topical corticosteroid alone, as occlusion significantly increases steroid absorption. It should not be used on infected skin." },
    { q: "What is eczema herpeticum and how serious is it?", a: "Eczema herpeticum is a rare but potentially serious complication of atopic dermatitis caused by herpes simplex virus infecting areas of eczematous skin. It presents as small, painful, punched-out ulcers or vesicles spreading across eczema-affected areas, often accompanied by fever and general unwellness. It is distinguishable from infected bacterial eczema by the characteristic punched-out appearance of the lesions and the absence of yellow crusting. Eczema herpeticum requires urgent systemic antiviral treatment with acyclovir and should not be managed with topical steroids, which would worsen the viral spread. Malaysian eczema patients who notice this pattern should proceed to Accident and Emergency immediately." },
    { q: "Can stress trigger eczema flares in Malaysia?", a: "Yes. Psychological stress is a well-established eczema trigger through its effects on the immune system and the skin barrier. Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which alters immune signalling and reduces the skin's production of ceramides and antimicrobial peptides. In Malaysia's fast-paced urban work culture, chronic workplace stress is a significant contributor to the pattern of eczema that improves during holidays and worsens during exam periods, project deadlines or high-pressure work months. At Nexus Clinic KL, stress is included in the trigger assessment at every consultation." },
    { q: "Is the eczema consultation at Nexus Clinic KL free?", a: "The initial eczema consultation at Nexus Clinic KL is priced at RM 100 to RM 180 and includes a full clinical skin assessment, SCORAD severity scoring, eczema type identification, trigger profiling using a Malaysia-specific environmental checklist, a written personalised treatment plan covering all prescribed medications with detailed application instructions, and a written flare action plan. If your presentation requires additional investigation such as patch testing for suspected contact allergen, this is discussed and priced separately at the consultation." },

              Eczema in Malaysia is harder to control than eczema in temperate climates, and it deserves a treatment plan that acknowledges this. House dust mites, sweat, heat, humidity, and daily temperature cycling keep Malaysian patients in a cycle of flares that generic treatment plans never fully address.
            </p>
            <p className="text-cream/90 font-inter">
              Every eczema patient receives a severity-matched treatment protocol, a written trigger management guide calibrated to Malaysian conditions, a flare action plan they can follow at home, and the correct information about their medications to use them effectively without fear.
